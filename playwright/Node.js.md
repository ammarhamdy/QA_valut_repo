# Node.js  is:
> A runtime environment that allows you to run **JavaScript outside of a browser**.

- **Node.js** = JavaScript engine + extra tools to run scripts on your computer

- **`npm`** = the package manager that installs libraries like Playwright or TypeScript

- Together, they let you build modern tools without opening a browser


# Why we need Node.js for Playwright
Playwright is written in **JavaScript/TypeScript**.  
To run it:
- We need **Node.js** to execute the code outside the browser.
- Node.js also manages **dependencies** (Playwright, TypeScript, etc.) via **`npm`** (Node Package Manager).
