# Introduction & Goals

Define the **purpose of testing** (e.g., ensure the product meets requirements, works as intended, and has acceptable quality).
    
State **high-level goals**, for example:
- Verify functional requirements are met.
- Ensure critical workflows are tested (happy path & edge cases).
- Detect and report defects early.
- Validate system stability, performance, and usability.


# Scope

**In-scope**: 
Which features/modules will be tested (e.g., login, payments, reporting).
    
**Out-of-scope**: 
What won’t be tested (e.g., third-party integrations outside QA’s control).


# Types of Testing

Here you list the types of testing you’ll use:

- **Functional Testing** – Verify that features work as per requirements.

- **Regression Testing** – Ensure new changes don’t break existing features.
    
- **Integration Testing** – Check how different modules interact.
    
- **User Interface (UI) Testing** – Verify UI elements, layout, and consistency.
    
- **Performance Testing** – Test load, stress, and responsiveness (if required).
    
- **Security Testing** – Validate authentication, authorization, and data protection.
    
- **Usability Testing** – Ensure the app is user-friendly and intuitive حدسي. 
    
- **Acceptance Testing (UAT)** – Ensure the product meets business needs.


# Test Environment

Define where testing will happen (QA environment, staging, production).

Mention required **tools and configurations** (e.g., browsers, devices, databases).


# Test Deliverables المخرجات

- Test scenarios/cases
    
- Test data
    
- Bug/defect reports
    
- Test execution report
    
- Final QA sign-off


# Entry & Exit Criteria

**Entry**: 
Requirements are defined, code is deployed in QA, test data ready.
    
**Exit**: 
All critical bugs fixed, regression passed, no open severity-1 issues.


# Risks & Mitigation

Example risks:    

- Limited test data → Create synthetic data.

- Tight deadlines → Prioritize critical test cases.


# Schedule & Resources

- Timeline for test phases.
    
- QA team roles & responsibilities.
